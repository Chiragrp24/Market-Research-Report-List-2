<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autothermal Reformer (ATR) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-desulfurization</li><li>Desulfurization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>An Autothermal Reformer (ATR) is a device used in the production of hydrogen, primarily for fuel cells. It combines partial oxidation and steam reforming of hydrocarbon fuels, such as natural gas or methane, to generate hydrogen gas. The ATR market can be classified into two types: non-desulfurization and desulfurization. In non-desulfurization, the ATR operates without a desulfurization unit, resulting in lower costs but a higher sulfur content in the hydrogen product. In desulfurization, a desulfurization unit is incorporated to reduce the sulfur content, leading to higher costs but a cleaner hydrogen product.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Autothermal Reformer (ATR) Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-reformed Gas</li><li>Refinery Off Gas</li><li>Natural Gas</li><li>Fischer-Tropsch tail-Gas</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Autothermal Reformer (ATR) is used in various market applications such as Pre-reformed Gas, Refinery Off Gas, Natural Gas, and Fischer-Tropsch tail-Gas. ATR technology enables the efficient conversion of these feedstocks into valuable synthesis gas (syngas) that can be further processed into products such as hydrogen, ammonia, or liquid fuels. Pre-reformed Gas refers to the process of reforming hydrocarbons prior to entering the ATR. Refinery Off Gas and Natural Gas are both ideal feedstocks for ATR due to their high methane content. Fischer-Tropsch tail-Gas is the residual gas produced during the conversion of synthesis gas into liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process.</p></p>
