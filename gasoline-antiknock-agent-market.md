<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gasoline Antiknock Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ethers Antiknock Agent</li><li>Metal Antiknock Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gasoline antiknock agent market consists of two main types: ethers antiknock agents and metal antiknock agents. Ethers antiknock agents are chemical compounds that help reduce engine knocking by increasing the octane rating of gasoline. These compounds, such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), are produced by reacting alcohols with isobutylene. On the other hand, metal antiknock agents, such as tetraethyl lead (TEL), contain metal compounds that form a protective layer on engine surfaces, reducing knocking. However, concerns over lead pollution led to the phase-out of TEL usage in most countries.</p></p>
