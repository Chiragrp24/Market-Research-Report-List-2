<p><strong>The Metal Ion Containing (MIC) & Metal Ion Free (MIF) Photoresist Developer Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist Process</li><li>Negative Photoresist Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Metal Ion Containing (MIC) photoresist developer is used in the positive photoresist process, where a pattern is created by exposing areas of the photoresist to light. The metal ions in the developer enhance the dissolution rate of the exposed areas, resulting in the desired pattern. On the other hand, Metal Ion Free (MIF) photoresist developer is used in the negative photoresist process, where the unexposed areas are dissolved. MIF developers do not contain metal ions, providing high selectivity and improved resolution for precise patterning. Both processes find application in various industries like semiconductor manufacturing and microfabrication.</p></p>
