<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ethylene Dichloride (EDC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Chlorination</li><li>Oxychlorination</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ethylene Dichloride (EDC) is an important chemical used in the production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), which is further processed into polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The EDC market can be divided into two types: direct chlorination and oxychlorination. Direct chlorination involves reacting ethylene with chlorine, while oxychlorination involves reacting ethylene with oxygen and chlorine. Both processes produce EDC, but direct chlorination is more common due to lower costs. The choice between the two methods depends on factors such as availability of raw materials, cost-effectiveness, and environmental considerations.</p></p>
