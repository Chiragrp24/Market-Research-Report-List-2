<p><strong>The Residential Solar PV Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>String Inverters</li><li>Micro Inverters</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Residential Solar PV Inverters are crucial components of solar energy systems that convert the direct current (DC) produced by solar panels into alternating current (AC) used for household electricity. There are two main types of residential solar PV inverters: String Inverters and Micro Inverters. String Inverters connect multiple solar panels in series, converting the DC power from the whole string. Micro Inverters, on the other hand, are attached to each individual solar panel and convert the DC power directly where it is produced. Both types have their advantages and are suitable for different residential solar energy setups.</p></p>
