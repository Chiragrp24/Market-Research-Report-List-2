<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disinfectants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidising Disinfectants</li><li>Non-oxidising Disinfectants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Disinfectants are essential in maintaining cleanliness and hygiene. There are two main types: oxidising disinfectants and non-oxidising disinfectants. Oxidising disinfectants work by releasing oxygen molecules which damage and destroy the cell walls of microorganisms, effectively killing them. Common examples include hydrogen peroxide and chlorine compounds. Conversely, non-oxidising disinfectants do not rely on oxygen molecules to eliminate microorganisms. Instead, they work by disrupting the cellular processes of pathogens, preventing their growth and replication. Prominent non-oxidising disinfectants include quaternary ammonium compounds and phenolic compounds. Both types are crucial in various settings, such as hospitals, homes, and public spaces, for maintaining cleanliness and preventing the spread of disease.</p></p>
