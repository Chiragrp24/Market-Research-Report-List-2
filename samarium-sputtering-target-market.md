<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Samarium Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Samarium sputtering targets are used in various applications, and the market can be categorized based on the target's type. Rotary-type targets are designed to rotate during the sputtering process, which ensures uniform erosion and deposition. They are commonly used in large-scale coating equipment. On the other hand, non-rotatable type targets remain stationary during sputtering. These targets are generally utilized in smaller-scale or handheld sputtering systems, where rotation is not necessary. Both market types cater to different equipment and coating requirements within industries like electronics, optics, and solar cells.</p></p>
