<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Darrieus</li><li>Savonius</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) market comprises two main types: the Darrieus and Savonius turbines. The Darrieus turbines have a tall, vertical axis with curved blades that resemble an egg beater and are typically installed in high-altitude areas. On the other hand, Savonius turbines have a shorter, vertical axis and feature a unique "S" or "U" shaped design. They are better suited for low wind speed regions and are often used for small-scale applications or in urban areas. Both types offer distinct advantages and are utilized based on the specific wind conditions and application requirements.</p></p>
