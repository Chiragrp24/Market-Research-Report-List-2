<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ice Axes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bent</li><li>Straight</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>There are two main types of ice axes in the market: bent and straight. A bent ice axe features a curved shaft, which provides better clearance and is favored by technical climbers. This design allows for efficient progress on steep terrain. On the other hand, a straight ice axe has a traditional, non-curved shaft. It is generally used for hiking, mountaineering, and basic alpine climbing. The straight design provides stability and versatility, making it suitable for a wide range of activities in less technical settings.</p></p>
