<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Speciality malt is a type of malt used in various industries, particularly in the production of alcoholic beverages like beer and whiskey. There are two main types of speciality malt: roasted malt and caramelized malts. Roasted malt is produced by subjecting the malted barley to higher temperatures, resulting in a darker color and strong flavor profile. It is often used to add a rich, toasted, or coffee-like taste to beverages. Caramelized malts, on the other hand, are created by heating the malted barley at lower temperatures, leading to a sweet and caramel-like flavor and lighter color. Both types of speciality malt offer unique characteristics and contribute distinct tastes to the final product.</p></p>
