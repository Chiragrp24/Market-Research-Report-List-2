<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Permeable Pavement Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Permeable pavement materials are designed to allow rainwater and stormwater to pass through them and infiltrate into the ground, reducing runoff and mitigating flooding. Pervious concrete is a type of pavement material made with low coarse aggregate content and high porosity, allowing water to rapidly drain through it. Porous asphalt, on the other hand, is made with a special mix of asphalt and aggregates that create interconnected voids, enabling water to permeate through it. Both materials are useful in managing stormwater and improving water quality.</p></p>
